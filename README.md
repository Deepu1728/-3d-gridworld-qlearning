# -3d-gridworld-qlearning
In a 6×6×6 gridworld with obstacles, an agent moves stochastically in six directions. Steps cost −1, goals give +50, pits −50. Using Q-learning, it updates Q-values from rewards and future estimates. Over time, it learns by trial and error to avoid pits, reach the goal, and follow paths that maximize long-term rewards.
